1. what is recursion?

A method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

A method calls itself from within its code


2. pros

- bridges the gap btn elegance and complexity hence works well with trees, graphs, json objects etc
- reduces need for complex loops and auxillary data structures
- can reduce time complexity easily with memoization


3. cons

- slowness due to cpu overhead(call stack/frames)
- can lead to out of memory errors/stack overflow exceptions
- can be unnecessarily complex if poorly constructed
